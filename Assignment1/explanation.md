Technical Achivements:
There are several technical achivements in this assignment. The original goal of this assignment to get used to live programming, which I haven't done before. 
It is really a magic for me, so I aimed to try more methods.

In terms of methods, I have tried the following:  
- Basic Math: 1) Rotate, 2) rand, 3) sin & cos, 4) clamp, 5) smoothstep, 6) length, dot, fract, floor, circle, abs 
- Manipulation: 7) snoise & noise, 8) fbm, 9) voronoi, 10) uv,
- Some other self defined functions: draw net, draw wave

Regarding the draw net function, I learned substentially from this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CycKKJiwis)
I have understood and modified some of the components within to achieve my effects. However, since of the majority of functions provided by tutorial are optimized for usage, there is an amount of overlap there.

Overall, I split the canvas into grids and draw points (stars) accordingly there. I was trying noise manipulations, but that will just make the point seemingly weird, so I left the stars in a spherical shape.
Then, I moved on to draw the wave at foreground, and I used a time-dependent randomization method to try with the effects. However, those effects were too powerful, so I have to scale them down, and the final effect is not bad.

Asthetic Goals:
- I was trying to provide a feeling of universe to audiences. After researches, I found the tutorial mentioned above, and I feel it is very cool for me to learn to get used to live programming.
- Also, I deliberately only used the color of black and white in this assignment because I want to provide that "simplism" feeling of universe to the audience.
- To provide a sense of universe, I was planning to provide a wave that is changable based on the sound and a background scene with a feeling of universe.
- For the foreground, I was planning to draw a wave in a more jumping way as a tool to bring the music closer to audience. However, I failed to make it "dancing" to a greater extend, but it is not bad right now.
- For the background, I learned from the tutorial to create a dots + lines combination to show the feeling of stars. If time allows, I will dive more into the tutorial and bring z-axis animations. 
- After that, audiences should see an "approching universe with stars" at the background with a "jumping music" at foreground, which is nearly 90% right now.

Feedback: 
I have received feedback from Bernnan Aubuchon. He commented it as calming and pretty. He liked the lights and lines at the back side, and it did remind him of constellations even though I did not tell him beforehand that the theme for this assignment is universe.
Therefore, I definitely think the combination of music + the background really provides the feeling I desire. Also, he thought that the wave at front went well with music, and that was intentional as well. 
However, the overall experience is simple right now - there are not that many transitions. In the future, I will definitely bring in the z-axis aniamtions and make the wave more "dancing" to offer a better experience.
